                    <ol>
                    <li><b>Labor Surplus Economy</b></li><br />
                    <ul>
                    <li>India is a labor-surplus economy, particularly in agriculture, leading to low wages and productivity.</li><br />
                    <li>This cycle limits investment in skills and technology, keeping productivity stagnant.</li><br />
                    </ul><br />
                    <li><b>Investment and Capital Formation</b></li><br />
                    <ul>
                    <li>Economic growth relies on investments in infrastructure, technology, and industries.</li><br />
                    <li>Capital formation, which includes increasing assets like factories, machinery, and education, is crucial for progress.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Industrialization and Structural Change</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Transitioning from an agriculture-based economy to industrial and service sectors is essential for development.</li><br />
        <li>This shift improves productivity and wages, contributing to overall economic growth.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Productivity Growth and Workforce Transition</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Investing in technology and skills enhances worker productivity.</li><br />
        <li>Surplus labor from agriculture should be absorbed into industries to reduce disguised unemployment and improve efficiency.</li><br />
        <li>Large rural populations need to transition into more productive sectors for sustainable growth.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Sustainable Economic Growth and Employment</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>The goal is to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth while ensuring full and productive employment for all.</li><br />
        <li>Fair employment opportunities and improved working conditions are key components.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Infrastructure and Industrial Development</b></li><br />

        <li>Strengthening industries, improving infrastructure, and fostering innovation drive economic development.</li><br />
        <li>Industrialization creates jobs and supports sustainable growth.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>India’s Rising GNI Per Capita</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>A steady increase in India’s GNI per capita over the years indicates sustained economic growth.</li><br />
        <li>The country has moved closer to higher income classifications over time.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Income Group Classification and Growth Trends</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>India’s GNI per capita has been steadily approaching higher-income thresholds, signaling economic advancement.</li><br />
        <li>Rapid growth, particularly since the 2000s, has been driven by economic liberalization, increased investments, and industrial growth.</li><br />
        <li>If India crosses a certain threshold, the World Bank may reclassify it from a lower-middle-income to an upper-middle-income country.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Employment Trends and Workforce Shifts</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>A rise in self-employment and household enterprises suggests a shift towards informal and entrepreneurial work due to limited salaried job opportunities.</li><br />
        <li>A decline in wage employment could indicate economic uncertainty, job market saturation, or automation-driven changes.</li><br />
        <li>Policymakers must focus on creating formal job opportunities, skilling the workforce, and supporting small businesses.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Economic Growth and Market Dynamics</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Higher salaries are essential for increasing investments and boosting economic growth.</li><br />
        <li>Increased production must be matched with demand and appropriate market mechanisms.</li><br />
        <li>Foreign investments enhance per capita income and overall economic growth.</li><br />
        <li>Exporting surplus production can improve GDP, as seen in historical trade models.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Industrial vs. Service Sector Contributions</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Industrial products (e.g., tangible goods like automobiles) differ from service products (e.g., software and financial services).</li><br />
        <li>Both play a vital role in economic development.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Sustainability and Economic Growth</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Sustainability must be promoted alongside increasing real GDP and annual growth.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>India’s Income Growth Trajectory</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>India moved from a low-income status before 2007 to lower-middle-income status.</li><br />
        <li>The country is now approximately 20% away from achieving high-income status.</li><br />

    <li><b>India’s Position in the Global Economy</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>India still has a long way to go before achieving high-income status compared to other global economies.</li><br />

        <li>MVA as a share of GDP.</li><br />
        <li>Manufacturing’s share in employment.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Expanding Manufacturing Employment</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>India must increase employment in manufacturing to balance its workforce distribution.</li><br />
        <li>Currently, agriculture employs a significant portion of the workforce, while the service sector remains underdeveloped.</li><br />
        <li>A structural shift from agriculture to services and industry is required.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Employment-Population Ratio and the Informal Sector</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>India has a low employment-to-population ratio due to a large informal workforce and a high number of unpaid domestic workers.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Declining Investment and Slower Growth</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Investment in manufacturing and other sectors has decreased in the past decade, slowing economic development.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Rising Costs and the Wage-Consumption Cycle</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Rising manufacturing costs and increasing food prices impact economic stability.</li><br />
        <li>Low wages force workers to spend most of their income on essentials, raising labor costs and limiting investments in other areas.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <ul>
        <li>Income inequality in India has grown over the past three decades.</li><br />
        <li>The top 10% of the population now holds 65% of the country’s total wealth, compared to 44.9% in 1961.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Shift Toward Self-Employment</b></li><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Growth in self-employment (household enterprises, small businesses, agriculture) is outpacing wage employment.</li><br />
        <li>Small businesses are driving economic growth more than large-scale investments.</li><br />
    </ul><br />

    <li><b>Women’s Employment and Economic Growth</b></li><br />
