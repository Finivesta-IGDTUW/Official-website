              <strong>Understanding Intrinsic Value:</strong> The importance of understanding the difference between the price of a stock and its intrinsic value. The price is what you pay, while the value is what you get. Investors should buy stocks whose intrinsic value is low compared to the price.

              <strong>Mr. Market:</strong> Graham personifies the stock market as "Mr. Market," who offers to buy or sell stocks to investors every day. He can be irrational, but investors can take advantage of his mood swings by buying when he's pessimistic and selling when he's optimistic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safe Side Investing:</strong> The book guides investors to buy stocks with low value risk.

            <li>
              <strong>Defensive vs. Enterprising Investing:</strong> There are two approaches to investing: defensive and enterprising. Defensive investors focus on long-term stability and income, while enterprising investors are more active and capitalize on market inefficiencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Term Perspective:</strong> The author emphasizes taking a long-term view when investing. Short-term market fluctuations should be ignored in favor of focusing on the underlying value of investments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analyzing Financial Statements:</strong> Guidance is provided on how to analyze a company's financial statements to determine its intrinsic value.
