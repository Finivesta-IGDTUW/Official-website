          Ramit Sethi's I Will Teach You to Be Rich is a no-nonsense, action-oriented guide designed
          to empower readers to take control of their finances. With a unique blend of humor,
          practicality, and psychology, Sethi offers a six-week program that simplifies complex financial
          concepts into actionable steps. The book focuses on optimizing credit cards, managing bank
          accounts, investing wisely, automating finances, and developing a conscious spending plan.
          Sethi aims to make personal finance approachable and relatable, especially for college
          students and young professionals. His intention is to remove the guilt and fear often
          associated with managing money, replacing it with confidence and clarity. He seeks to prove
          that financial independence is attainable for anyone willing to take small but deliberate steps.
